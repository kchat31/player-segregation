Candidates are required to follow this structure for final submissions.

## Instructions
All the ideas and approaches should be placed inside report.pdf file which covers 50% weightage of overall evaluation.
<br>

There is a folder called Implementation_1 where all your code should be placed. You are required to mention all the shell commands required to execute your code (including installation of packages) inside execute.sh shell script

We will simply execute 
```bash
./execute.sh
```
We expect this shell script to execute without any errors, to avoid any mismatch in python version we suggest you to use latest version of python3.

Also your code should create an output folder inside Implementation_1 directory which again will have four sub folders named player0, player1, player2 and player3. Your code should push images of corresponding players in above listed sub folders.

In case if you want to showcase multiple implementations then you can create folders similar to Implementation where naming should followed like this: Implementation_{index} Example: Implementation_2.

Also try to create one small pdf doc for each Implementation_{index} folder, so that we can check which approach you followed for the given implementation.

Please mention your college id the submission README.md (this file).

Also there is a Resume folder where you should place your resume (this is very important).
