Candidates are required to follow this structure for final submissions.

## Instructions
All the ideas and approaches should be placed inside Ideas folder and each idea must be added in form of pdf document with naming like this: idea_{index}.pdf
<br>
Note: Place your best approaches and ideas first, i.e. idea_1.pdf is expected to have better approach than one in idea_2.pdf. It is possible that based on total number of submissions we only check few top ideas of each submission, so please place them carefully.

There is a folder called Implementation where all your code should be placed. You are required to mention all the shell commands required to execute your code (including installation of packages) inside execute.sh shell script

We will simply execute 
```bash
./execute.sh
```
We expect this shell script to execute without any errors, to avoid any mismatch in python version we suggest you to use latest version of python3. Sometimes shell commands may differ based on the operating system, so please mention operating system as well where your code is expected to work.

In case if you want to showcase multiple implementations then you can create folders similar to Implementation where naming should followed like this: Implementation_{index} Example: Implementation_1.
